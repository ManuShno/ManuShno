# Manuel Nielsen
I am a full-stack developer and solution architect focussing primarily on the area of healthcare data.

My current primary project - [RODE][rode], is a comprehensive health data platform that integrates real-time communications with business intelligence and best practice data governance. This architecture supports a distributed data system that maintains an organisation's data segregation within the architecture. The initial version is a purpose built [Kubernetes][kubernetes] platform bootstrapped on bare metal Virtual Machines. The production version of the application will be running on [AWS][aws] utilising the AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service.
